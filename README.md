# LifeCycle Analysis Protocols
These provide researchers with a list of standard functions for data manipulations and analyses in DataSHIELD; these can be adapted to each specific research question. The protocols are currently fairly simple, but will become more extensive as our experience of DataSHIELD develops.

## Protocols
There are two groups of protocols: *project setup* and *methods*.

### Project setup
These set of files are containing functions that provide a layer over DataSHIELD that allows researcheers to do their project setup very fast.

- [connecting to the opal instances](R/connection.R)
- [summarizing data](R/summaries.R)

### Methods
Coding for standard data analysis in DataSHIELD.

- [comparing two means](R/comparing_two_means.R)
