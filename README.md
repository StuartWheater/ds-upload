# LifeCycle Analysis Protocols
The idea here is to provide researchers with a list of functions that may be useful for various data manipulations/analyses, that the researcher can adapt to their own specific research question. These protocols are currently fairly simple, but we hope they will become more extensive as LifeCycle learns more about DataSHIELD. 

## Protocols
We divided the different protocols that we have created now in 2 groups. Setup the project and basic methods.

### Basic setup
These set of files are containing functions that provide a layer over DataSHIELD that allows researcheers to do their project setup very fast.

- [connection](R/connection.R)
- [summaries](R/summaries.R)

### Basic methods
Specify some basic statistical methods

- [comparing two means](R/comparing_two_means.R)
